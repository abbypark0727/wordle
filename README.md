# Wordle (Java)

A Java implementation of the popular word puzzle game **Wordle**, built in IntelliJ.  
Players have six attempts to guess a hidden five-letter word, with feedback given after each guess:  
- ðŸŸ© **Green** â†’ correct letter in the correct spot  
- ðŸŸ¨ **Yellow** â†’ correct letter in the wrong spot  
- â¬› **Gray** â†’ letter not in the word  

This version includes both the **classic mode** and the **typical Hard Mode**, where every hint must be used in subsequent guesses.  

## Features
- Object-oriented design in Java  
- Command-line gameplay  
- Classic rules + optional Hard Mode  
- Modular structure for easy extension (e.g., larger word lists, GUI support)  

## Tech Stack
- **Java** (IntelliJ IDE)  
- Object-Oriented Programming principles  

## How to Run
1. Clone the repo  
2. Open in IntelliJ (or any Java IDE)  
3. Run `Main.java` to start the game
